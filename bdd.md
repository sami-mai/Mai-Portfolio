# Portfolio Website

You need a portfolio. Out of all the projects, you have built I am sure there are some you really want to show off. And that will be your task for this week.

You will create a Django application that will list and display all your "braggable" projects. The application should allow a User to:

* View all the awesome Projects.
* View details about that project including images/screenshots description a link to the Github repository and deployed link.

#Requirements
* Your project should have simple to navigate URL system
* Your Project should have proper design and fully responsive
* Your Project should contain an admin panel where you will add the project.
* Your project should be submitted to Heroku and hosted.
* The Project should contain unit tests to test all our model logic and view function logic
* The project should contain migrations that have changes to the database.

Feel free to put your own touch on the project remember that design is a make or break factor for a full stack developer.
